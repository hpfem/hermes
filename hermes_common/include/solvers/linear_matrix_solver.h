    /// \ brief Options for matrix factorization reuse.
    ///
    /// Reusing the information computed during previous solution of a similar problem
    /// significantly improves efficiency of the solver.
    ///
    /// <b>Usage:</b>
    /// Each solver which allows factorization reuse should perform complete factorization
    /// from scratch for the first time it is invoked, keep the precomputed structures
    /// according to the current factorization reuse stratregy and use them for next
    /// factorization.
    ///
    /// <b>Enabled solvers:</b>
    ///&nbsp;-\c SuperLU - performs reordering, scaling and factorization separately. When the
    ///&nbsp;              multithreaded version is used, scaling is performed during the factorization
    ///&nbsp;              phase (if neccessary) and thus \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING
    ///&nbsp;              and \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING have the same effect.
    ///&nbsp;-\c UMFPack - like the MT version of SuperLU, performs scaling and factorization in one step.
    ///&nbsp;              \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING has thus the same effect as
    ///&nbsp;              \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING (saves the preceding symbolic analysis step).
    ///&nbsp;-\c MUMPS   - If \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING is set, scaling is performed
    ///&nbsp;              during analysis and only factorization is repeated during each solve.
    ///&nbsp;              If \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING is set, scaling is performed during
    ///&nbsp;              the factorization phase. This may be less efficient, but more reliable,
    ///&nbsp;              especially for highly non-symmetric matrices.
    ///&nbsp;-\c AMESOS  - Behaves like UMFPack.
    ///&nbsp;-\c PETSc   - Factorization reuse applies to the construction of PETSc preconditioner.
    ///&nbsp;              Both \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING_AND_SCALING and
    ///&nbsp;              \c HERMES_REUSE_MATRIX_REORDERING allow to reuse the non-zero pattern of the
    ///&nbsp;              previously created preconditioner, \c HERMES_REUSE_FACTORIZATION_COMPLETELY
    ///&nbsp;              indicates that the preconditioner may be reused completely for future solves.
    ///

    /// When \c rhsonly was set to \c true for the assembly phase,
    /// \c HERMES_REUSE_FACTORIZATION_COMPLETELY should be set for the following solution phase.
