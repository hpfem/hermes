    /*!\class NeighborSearch neighbor.h "src/neighbor.h"
    * \brief This class characterizes a neighborhood of a given edge in terms of adjacent elements
    *        and provides methods for getting limit values of discontinuous functions from both sides of the edge.
    *
    * Each instance of the class is connected to a mesh and its active element. The active element becomes the
    * <em> central element </em> of the neighborhood and all adjacent elements the <em> neighbors </em>.
    *
    * In order to search for the neighboring elements, one selects a particular edge of the central element and calls
    * the method \c set_active_edge. This enumerates the neighbors and fills in the array \c transformations, which
    * will be needed later for getting function values at matching points from both sides of the selected (active) edge.
    *
    * The actual procedure depends on the relative size of the central element with respect to the neighbor element(s)
    * across the active edge:
    *    - If active edge is shared by two elements of same size, then \c Element::get_neighbor is used to retrieve
    *      pointer to the neighboring element. Moreover, no transformations are needed to obtain values of any given
    *      function from either side of active edge.
    *    - If the neighbor element is bigger than the central element, then we "go up" on the central element, until
    *      we find its parent that has the same size as the neighbor. We keep track of the visited intermediate parents
    *      and after the final one has been found, we use them in reverse order to fill in the \c transformations array.
    *      These transformations will have to be pushed to a function on the neighboring (bigger) element in order to
    *      obtain values at points matching those from the central element's side.
    *    - If the neighbor element is smaller than the central element, it means that it is one of several neighbors
    *      across the active edge. Hence, we "go down" in the central element in order to find a (virtual) sub-element
    *      matching the currently processed neighbor and store the corresponding transformations in the neighbor's field
    *      of the array \c transformations. This way, we obtain for each neighbor a set of transformations which have to
      *      be applied on the central element to transform integration points to its correct part matching the neighbor.
    *
    * There may be either one or more neighbors (see below). In the second case, each of the neighbors shares with the
    * central element a unique segment of the active edge. The next step is therefore a loop through all neighbors,
    * setting the appropriate active segment through \c set_active_segment at the beginning of every iteration. This also
    * handles the "go-down" transformations of the attached central element's pss and creates a pss on the
    * neighbor element for use in evaluating discontinuous bilinear forms (see below).
    *
    * If only external functions are supposed to be discontinuous across the active edge (e.g. in the case of linear
    * forms), the \c init_ext_fn methods may now be used to create pointers to new \c DiscontinuousFunc objects - first to
    * one used for evaluating integration order and then, after computing the quadrature order for given form and setting
    * it via \c set_quad_order, to that with the actual values at the matching integration points from both sides of the
    * active segment.
    *
    * If also the test functions need to be considered discontinuous (e.g when assembling DG bilinear forms), the local
    * precalculated shapesets on the central element (attached from the assembling procedure) and on the current neighbor
    * element are extended by zero to the whole neighborhood of the two elements (see \c create_extended_shapeset).
    * A so-called <em> extended shapeset </em> thus created is stored in the variable \c supported_shapes and may be queried
    * for the count of all contained extended shapes and their global DOF numbers. Assembling is done over all shape
    * functions from the extended shapes. The user gets a pointer to the current extended shape function by calling
    * \c supported_shapes.get_extended_shape_fn and may use it then to obtain \c DiscontinuousFunc objects with the shape
    * function's order/values on both sides of active edge as in the previous case of external functions.
