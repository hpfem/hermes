    /// \brief Represents the solution of a PDE.
    ///
    /// The Solution class represents the solution of a PDE. Given a space and a solution vector,
    /// it calculates the appropriate linear combination of basis functions at the specified
    /// element and integration points.
    ///
    /// The higher-order solution on elements is best calculated not as a linear combination
    /// of shape functions (the usual approach), but as a linear combination of monomials.
    /// This has the advantage that no shape function table calculation and look-ups are
    /// necessary (except for the conversion of the solution coefficients), which means that
    /// visualization and multi-mesh calculations are much faster (all the push_transforms
    /// and table searches take the most time when evaluating the solution).
    ///
    /// The linear combination of monomials can be calculated using the Horner's scheme, which
    /// requires the same number of multiplications as the calculation of the linear combination
    /// of shape functions. However, sub-element transforms are trivial and cheap. Moreover,
    /// after the solution on all elements is expressed as a combination of monomials, the
    /// Space can be forgotten. This is comfortable for the user, since the Solution class acts
    /// as a self-contained unit, internally containing just a copy of the mesh and a table of
    /// monomial coefficients. It is also very straight-forward to obtain all derivatives of
    /// a solution defined in this way. Finally, it is possible to store the solution on the
    /// disk easily (no need to store the Space, which is difficult).
    ///
    /// The following is an example of the set of monomials for a cubic quad and a cubic triangle.
    /// (Note that these are actually the definitions of the polynomial spaces on these elements.)
    ///
    ///   [ x^3*y^3  x^2*y^3  x*y^3  y^3 ]       [                    y^3 ]
    ///   [ x^3*y^2  x^2*y^2  x*y^2  y^2 ]       [             x*y^2  y^2 ]
    ///   [ x^3*y    x^2*y    x*y    y   ]       [      x^2*y  x*y    y   ]
    ///   [ x^3      x^2      x      1   ]       [ x^3  x^2    x      1   ]
