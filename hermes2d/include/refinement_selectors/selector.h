/** \defgroup g_selectors Refinement Selectors
*  \brief Refinement selectors allows to select a refinement
*  according to an error of a candidate.
*
*  The error is calculate by comparing a candidate projected
*  to a reference solution with the reference solution. All selectors
*  has to be derived from the class Selector. An instance of
*  a selector should be created outside the adaptivity loop
*  in order to save initialization time.
*
*  Currently available selectors:
*  - static selectors: Selectors that does not support
*    a mechanism for selecting an optimal refinement from
*    a list of refinements.
*    -# HOnlySelector
*    -# POnlySelector
*  - optimum selectors: Selectors that are able to select
*    a refinement from a provided list of possibilities
*    which minimizes the error. All optimum selectors have
*    to be derived from the class OptimumSelector.
*    -# H1ProjBasedSelector
