    /// \brief Represents a finite element space over a domain.
    ///
    /// The Space class represents a finite element space over a domain defined by 'mesh', spanned
    /// by basis functions constructed using 'shapeset'. It serves as a base class for H1Space,
    /// HcurlSpace, HhivSpace and L2Space, since most of the functionality is common for all these spaces.
    ///
    /// There are four main functions the Space class provides:
    /// <ol>
    ///    <li> It handles the Dirichlet (essential) boundary conditions. The user provides a pointer
    ///         to an instance of the EssentialBCs class that determines
    ///         which markers represent the Dirichlet part of the boundary, and which markers represent
    ///         the Neumann and Newton parts. It is also possible to use the value BC_NONE
    ///         which supresses all BC processing on such part of the boundary.
    ///
    ///         The default BC type is BC_NATURAL for the whole boundary. The default BC value is zero for all
    ///         markers.
    ///
    ///    <li> It stores element polynomial degrees, or 'orders'. All active elements need to have
    ///         an order set for the Space to be valid. Individual orders can be set by calling
    ///         set_element_order(). You can also set the same order for all elements using
    ///         set_uniform_order(). Quadrilateral elements can have different orders in the vertical
    ///         and horizontal directions. It is therefore necessary to form the order using the macro
    ///         H2D_MAKE_QUAD_ORDER() when calling the aforementioned functions.
    ///
    ///    <li> It builds and enumerates the basis functions. After all element orders have been set,
    ///         you must call the function assign_dofs(). This function assigns the DOF (degree-of-
    ///         freedom) numbers to basis functions, starting with 'first_dof' (optional parameter).
    ///         It also determines constraining relationships in the mesh due to hanging nodes and
    ///         builds constrained basis functions. The total number of basis functions can then
    ///         be obtained by calling  (). Standard basis functions are assigned positive
    ///         numbers from 'first_dof' to ('first_dof' + (get_num_dofs() - 1) * 'stride'). All
    ///         shape functions belonging to the Dirichlet lift are assigned DOF number of -1. This
    ///         way the Dirichlet lift becomes a (virtual) basis function. This simplifies assembling.
    ///
    ///    <li> Finally, and most importantly, the Space is able to deliver a list of shape functions
    ///         existing on each element. Such a list is called an "assembly list" and is represented
    ///         by the class AsmList<Scalar>. The assembly list contains the triplets (idx, dof, coef).
    ///         'idx' is the shape function index, as understood by the Shapeset. 'dof' is the number
    ///         of the basis function, whose part the shape function forms. 'coef' is a Real constant,
    ///         with which the shape function must be multiplied in order to fit into the basis
    ///         function. This is typically 1, but can be less than that for constrained functions.
    ///         Constrained vertex functions can belong to more than one basis functions. This
    ///         results in more triplets with the same 'idx'. However, the assembling procedure or
    ///         the Solution class do not have to worry about that. For instance, the Solution class
    ///         simply obtains the values of all shape functions contained in the list, multiplies them
    ///         by 'coef', and forms a linear combination of them by taking the solution vector values
    ///         at the 'dof' positions. This way the solution to the PDE is obtained.
    /// </ol>
    ///
    /// Space is an abstract class and cannot be instatiated. Use one of the specializations H1Space,
    /// HcurlSpace or L2Space instead.
    ///
    /// The handling of irregular meshes is desribed in H1Space and HcurlSpace.
