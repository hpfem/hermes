About Hermes
============

Hermes is a free C++/Python library for rapid development of
adaptive *hp*-FEM and *hp*-DG solvers for partial differential equations (PDE)
and multiphysics PDE systems. The development team includes the 
`hp-FEM group <http://hpfem.org/>`_ at the `University of Nevada, Reno <http://www.unr.edu>`_ 
and their `collaborators <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/blob/HEAD:/AUTHORS>`_ 
from numerous places around the globe.

A standard way to use Hermes is to write short C++ user programs 
that use the functionality provided by the library, but for 
those who prefer to use a graphical interface, there is 
`Agros2D <http://hpfem.org/agros2d/>`_.

Hermes is loaded with modern finite element technology and its user base is 
growing fast. We hope that you will enjoy the software and that you will find 
this documentation useful. In any case please let us know if you find mistakes 
or if you can suggest improvements to this documentation or to Hermes itself.
Anyone who contributes with at least one patch becomes automatically a 
`co-author <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/blob/HEAD:/AUTHORS>`_ of the code.

The library is available under the GPL license (Version 2, 1991).
