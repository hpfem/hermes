These installation instructions have been tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, and with MinGW

- Probably with small modifications, they should also work for NMake
- If you would like to use NMake and you run in troubles, drop us a line to `Hermes2D mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/hermes2d/>`_.

Building Hermes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In order to build the library and examples, you need to:

 - Prepare dependecy libraries, see 'Dependency Check-list'.
 - Copy a file 'CMake.vars.example' to 'CMake.vars'. The file contains settings for the project.
 - Modify the file 'CMake.vars'. For example, you 
   could set the first line as::

       set(DEP_ROOT "../dependencies")

 - In the directory 'my_hermes_root', to create project files by running CMAKE from a command prompt::

       cmake . -G "Visual Studio 8 2005"  # MSVC2005 user
       cmake . -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"  # MSVC2008 user
       cmake . -G "Visual Studio 10"      # MSVC2010 user
       cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"       # MSVC2010 user

   If you have Cygwin installed, your might have an error "Coulld not create named generator Visual Studio 10". This is because your 
   cmake path is contaminated by Cygwin's cmake. Try to use absolute path for windows cmake.exe. 
   
   You also need to copy the file 'my_hermes_root\\Win32\\inttypes.h' to the include folder in your dependency folder. In other words, you need to put it anywhere where your compiler will find it when "#include <inttypes.h>" is processed.

 - Open the SLN file 'my_hermes_root\\hermes.sln' and build Hermes.

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Hermes is configured through preprocessor directives. Directives are generated by CMAKE and your settings might be overriden by CMAKE. The directives are:

  - H2D_WITH_GLUT : If the line in CMake.vars.example "set(H2D_WITH_GLUT NO)" is uncommented, it excludes GLUT-dependant parts. This replaces viewers with an empty implementation that does nothing if invoked. If used, the library 'freeglut.lib' does not need to be linked. 

  - H2D_WITH_VIEWER_GUI : If the line "H2D_WITH_VIEWER_GUI" in CMake.vars.example is uncommented, it enables GUI for viewers. Currently, only 'ScalarView' support GUI because this is an experimental feature. This directive is mutually exclusive with H2D_WITH_GLUT. If used, a library 'AntTweakBar.lib' needs to be linked.

Using Hermes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
In order to use Hermes in your project, you need to do the following steps. Steps has 5, 6, and 7 to be repeated for every configuration, i.e., Debug, Release. Except the step 7b, this can be done easily by setting the drop-down Configuration to 'All configurations' in the Project Property dialog.

  - Prepare Hermes to be buildable by MSVC, see 'Building Hermes'.
  - Create your project in MSVC. Set the project to be an empty Win32 console project.
  - Add directories 'dependencies\\lib' to additional library directories (<right click on your project>\\Properties\\Configuration Properties\\Linker\\Additional Library Directories).
  - Add also the directory where you copied Hermes libraries to as an additional library directory. This would probably be the variable TARGET_ROOT in your CMake.vars file.
  - Add 'include "hermes2d.h"', make sure that your TARGET_ROOT is among Include Directories settings in your compiler.
  - Add the dependencies\\include directory (and possibly other directories where you copied dependency headers) using  
    - Project -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories:
			
  - Deny (Ignore) warnings that are not indicating anything dangerous:

    - Ignore warnings about STL in DLL by denying a warning 4251 (<right click on your project>\\Properties\\Configuration Properties\\C/C++\\Advanced\\Disable Specific Warnings, enter 4251).
    - Ignore warnings about standard functions that are not safe (<right click on your project>\\Properties\\Configuration Properties\\C/C++\\Preprocessor\\Preprocessor Definitions, add _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS).
    - Also ignore any template instantiation warnings
  - Resolve LIBCMTD.lib LNK2005 errors when building hermes2D (This only happened once)

Dependency check-list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list works for 32-bit version of Hermes.
	
  - Be sure to include a directory 'dependecies\\bin' into 'PATH' environment variable.
  - All Hermes project files assumes that dependency libraries are available in a fixed directory structure. The root of this structure has to have the same parent as does Hermes director, i.e., if 'C:\\my_work\\hermes\\' is a root of the Hermes directory, then 'C:\\my_work\\dependecies\\' is a root of the dependency directory. Subdirectories are:

    - dependencies\\include: Header files (\*.h) of dependency libraries.
    - dependencies\\lib: Library files (\*.lib) of dependency libraries.   
    - dependencies\\bin: Binary modules (\*.dll) of dependency libraries. Be sure to include a directory 'dependecies\\bin' into 'PATH' environment variable.


  - PTHREAD(2.8.0)

    - Download pthread binaries version 2.8.0 (ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/prebuilt-dll-2-8-0-release/).
    - Copy 'lib\\pthreadVCE2.dll', 'include\\\*.h' and 'lib\\pthreadVCE2.lib' to 'bin', 'include', and 'lib' dependecy directories respectively.

  - UMFPACK
  
    - notes from Graham Sortino:
	  - MinGW used for compiling AMD and UMFPACK
	  
	  - when running make files on windows I needed to replace windows style syntax with it's windows equivalents. For example:
	    
		- Replace all ';' symbols in the makefile command syntax with the windows equivalent '&'
	    - Remove all './' references in the makefile command syntax when the purposes is to execute a script or process. Windows does not use these.

	  - UFconfig.mk
	  
	    -	CC = gcc
	    -	# CFLAGS = -O
	    - C++ compiler (also uses CFLAGS)
		
	      - CPLUSPLUS = g++
	    - Change your rm and mv commands to their windows equivalent:
		
	      - RM = del
	      - MV = move

	  - AMD
	  
	    - When building demo remove the diff commands from the demo Makefile
